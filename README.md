# TIY Database with CSV and Enumerable
## The Iron Yard Cohort 7 Week 2 Day 4 Weekend Homework

You have been hired to create an app to manage information about employees. Create an application that can add, search, and delete people from a master list. Your previous implementation was awesome. Now the customer has come back and suggested that it would be great if your application saved the information between runs of the application.

Your task is to add the ability to read the employees file named employees.csv and write them back to the same file so we keep track of all the employees.

Your senior engineer also wants you to upgrade the code to use enumerable instead of loops.
